# Instructions for Notes

Notes is designed to help you practice using what you learned in this Unit. You will have to use UITableViewControllers, different UIKit elements, segues, outlets, actions, and persistence with UserDefaults.

Please fork and clone this repository, then watch the screen recording provided before starting. This will show you what you need to build. Your project must display note items in a table view, persist note items across app launches using UserDefaults, allow the user to add notes to the list using a detail view, and allow the user to see existing notes using the same detail view. Best of luck.
